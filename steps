1. Title of work: Example: “Stock market analysis using Machine Learning”.
2. Introduction: Introduction about the work, Machine Learning, 
depending upon your work (Financial Analysis or Natural Language, or Weather Forecasting or text mining) 
and brief explanation about HMM/CRFs and how it will used for your work .
3. Problem definition: Aims and objectives are determined taking into consideration certain factors 
like the current background and future prospective.
4. Data Preparation: The data is prepared for modelling by cleansing and formatting the raw data in the desired way. 
The meaning of data is not changed while preparing.
5. Data Pre-processing: Data pre-processing involves data type conversion, label encoding, handling missing values,
handling time-series data etc
6. Data exploration: Required data is collected and explored using various statistical methods 
along with identification of underlying problems.
7. Modelling: In this phase the data model is created by applying Hidden Markov Modelling or 
Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) Modelling . After the model is created it goes through validation and verification.
8. Evaluation: After the model is created, it is evaluated to check whether it satisfies objectives or not.
9. Deployment: After evaluation, the model is deployed, a properly organized report is 
prepared with the summary of the work done.
10. Conclusion: Key findings about your work and conclusion
